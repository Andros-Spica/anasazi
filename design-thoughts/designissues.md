- issue the problem of death of households as implemented in the model, & the intersection with player agency
  - this is a problem of translation from ABM to player agency. The player can't simply have the role of one agent in the model
    - so we address this by creating an external agent, the player
    - the player influences the probabilities of agent choices
    - in game itself the player is interacting with characters, trying to influence or convince them of a particular choice
    - time in the model is yearly, discrete, cyclical, so the player can only interact with the agents in 'vignettes' over time
    - player has to pick up on visual cues in the environment in order to have the information to influence the agents
    - story emerges by tracking agents/characters/lineages over time, as player 'incarnates' in time

- settlements - we need to create some rule of aggregation of households, as this is *not* included in the original model
